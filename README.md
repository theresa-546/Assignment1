# Version Control and Collaboration

This is a remix of Ivette Cortez's HTML and CSS assignment. 

Here is her original [project](https://github.com/ivettegcortez/Assignment1)

I changed the live version of Lion King's clip to the original one and changed some the cat clip to another cat gif. I kept her original idea of cats to the project because I also really like cats.
